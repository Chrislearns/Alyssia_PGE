    willing to go the extra mile. And as you can assess from this presentation, you don't
     have to look any further. You need experience on your side. With more then a decade of
     customer service experience, bringing clarity and satifaction to consumer inquiries
     has come to be my specialty. I understand that the customers are
     the backbone of our organization and with that knowledge I strive to give no less
     than 120% when it comes to making the customer happy. </p>

  <p class="headline">Good at analyzing an issue, comfortable with suggesting
     solutions/options to a customer and passionate about offering a great customer experience?</p>
